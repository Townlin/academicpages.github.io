I'm an undergrduate student from School of Physics, Peking University. My research interest includes quantum computation and quantum simulation( especially the physical realization of quantum computation).



一个正在搭建的个人学术主页 A self scholar-page in building
======
我在2024年12月31日突然想到要做一个自己的主页，于是马上着手，fork自GitHub上academicpage的仓库。

It occured to me that I wanted to build my own scholar-page on December 31, 2024, so I took action right away. This page is forked from academicpage on GitHub.


这里有什么 What's here
======
1. 由于这个网页才刚刚起步，里面没有太多内容，我会不断在网页上更新内容，来让页面更加充实。

   Now that this page is on halfway, there's not much content. I will continuously upload to enrich it.
2. 因为我暂时没时间去学习更多的网页技术，所以我没办法给主页加上中英文切换的功能，就只好手动给每条信息都列上中英文（虽然这样看上去非常愚蠢），并且由于我的英语水平有限，很可能充斥着语法错误。

   For reason that I don't have enough time to master more web technology, I can't add language switch function on homepage. So I have to manually list both Chinese and English (though reaaly stupid), and due to my poor English level, it could be filled with grammar mistakes.
3. 目前我还没有出版的论文或书籍，以后如果我有了发表的机会，我将更新在出版物栏目。

   I still don't have any published paper or book, if I do in the future, I will update them in Publications Column.
4. 讨论栏目里罗列的是我的组会或讨论课幻灯片/文档，点进去以后有下载链接。
   Talks Column contains slides of my conference or talk-class, you can get a download link after click in.
5. 我还没有想好文件夹放些什么东西，可能会变成我的云文件夹吧。

   I don't have any idea what to store in Portfolio Column, maybe it will become my next iCloud.
6. 我不知道大家都拿博客发些什么，可能我会发一些碎碎念，日常之类的东西，纯当做记事本了。

   I don't how others take Blog Posts, I would post some chattering, something concerned with my everyday life. Just a notebook.
7. 简历还在不断更新，目前只是个模版罢了。

   CV is still on its way, it's only a template now.
8. 导览是给我看的。

   The Guide Column is for me.
